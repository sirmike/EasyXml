This is a very simple tool that I wrote many years ago which helped me to efficiently view portions of xml log files. It stays in a system tray and when a hotkey is pressed it sends CTRL+C to the active window. Then it writes clipboard data to an xml file and opens it in a configured application.

The repo does not have a history as it was imported from non-scm folder.
